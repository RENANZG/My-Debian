Automation & Configuration Management

Terraform
Terraform is an open source, Infrastructure-as-Code provisioning tool that stores cloud infrastructure setup as codes. It uses HashiCorp configuration language (HCL), and is used for server orchestration. Ansible can also automate Terraform with community modules.

Chef
Chef is a configuration management tool based in Ruby that uses a declarative, agent-based model. It refers to the Chef automation instruction as recipes (groups of which are called cookbooks).

Puppet
Puppet is an agent-based open source community project. Puppet Enterprise is an open source product. Both are automation tools that manage and automate server configuration. Both are written in Ruby and use Puppet manifests for automation instruction.

Salt
The Salt project is an open source project sponsored by VMware. SaltStack is the open source product owned by VMware. Built on Python, both use YAML and event-driven automation to deploy and configure complex IT systems.
